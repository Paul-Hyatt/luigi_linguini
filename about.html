<h2>Learn About Our Humble Beginnings</h2>

<p>Our story begins with our founder, Luigi Ricci. Luigi never really fit in at school. He was not particularly good at his academics and did not have much athletic or musical ability for extracurriculars. At sixteen, Luigi was ready to drop out. That was, until, he had a revelation on his walk home from school one day.</p>
<p>Luigi was walking through an alleyway close to his home when a swift movement caught the corner of his vision. Startled, he looked down to see a small rat scurrying with some cheddar. He watched in awe as the rat delivered the cheese to a group of rats. While the rats dined on their cheese, Luigi thought &#34;maybe I can whip the cheddar like that rat one day&#34;.</p>
<p>Luigi hurried home where he scrounged through the ingredients and cookbooks his mother had in the kitchen. When his mother, Sofia Ricci, returned home an hour later, Luigi had dinner prepared. His mother took one bite and realized her son had a magnificent gift. The very next day Luigi joined cooking classes and began to excel in school. As soon as he graduated, Luigi opened up his restaurant. Twenty years later that restaurant still stands.</p>
<p>We hope that with every bite of our delicious linguini, this story of our humble beginnings will be remembered by others and inspire them to search for their calling in life.</p>
